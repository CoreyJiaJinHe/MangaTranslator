Plan is:

We use mangaocr.

We use cv2 find contours. 

We look for contours that cover less than 50% of the page.
We filter out overlapping contours.
We display the remaining contours. Remaining contours should be between 0-10. User gets to choose which ones to keep and send to manga-ocr.
User also gets to draw his own rectangle selection.
Whenever a user draws his own selection, once it is done, it gets sent to manga-ocr to ocr.




To improve contour detection and reduce false positives (wrong contours), consider these strategies:

1. **Tune Threshold Values**:  #Already tried.
    - Adjust the fixed and Otsu threshold values. Too low/high thresholds can merge or split text regions incorrectly.
    - Try adaptive thresholding with different block sizes and constants.

2. **Morphological Operations**:   #Try this.
    - Experiment with kernel size and shape in `cv2.dilate` and also try `cv2.erode` or `cv2.morphologyEx` (e.g., `cv2.MORPH_OPEN` to remove noise).
    - Use smaller kernels or fewer iterations to avoid merging separate text lines/boxes.

3. **Contour Filtering**: #More filtering is fine. Aspect ratio checks is ideal.
    - Increase the minimum width/height or area for accepted contours.
    - Add aspect ratio checks (e.g., ignore extremely wide or tall boxes unlikely to be text).
    - Filter by contour area, perimeter, or solidity (contour area / bounding rect area).

4. **Subsumed Rectangles**:
    - Enable and tune the "subsumed by larger rect" logic to remove nested or overlapping boxes.

5. **Preprocessing**:  
    - Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise before thresholding.
    - Use contrast enhancement (e.g., `cv2.equalizeHist` or `ImageOps.autocontrast`).

6. **Postprocessing**:  
    - Merge overlapping or nearby rectangles if they likely belong to the same text block.
    - Remove rectangles near the image border if your images have noisy edges.

7. **Debugging**:  
    - Visualize each step and compare overlays to see which parameters best isolate text.
