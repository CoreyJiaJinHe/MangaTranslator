1. Always focus on clarity when it comes to variable naming scheme.
2. Always ensure comments to explain what the code is doing, especially for complex logic.
3. Do not touch files inside folders that say do not use.
4. Imports should always be at the top of the file. No inline imports unless necessary. Explain why an inline import is necessary when you decide so.
5. When you are given multiple instructions in a single prompt, create a to-do list of tasks and proceed sequentially through each task. You are not allowed to skip a task simply because you decide not to.
6. Once you have created your plan, you begin working on the tasks. You do not 'ask' the user to proceed with the plan, you proceed.
7. When you generate code, ensure there are no scope and indentation errors. Should they appear, fix them before finishing.
